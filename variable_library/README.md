## Variable Libraries

# Variable Library

Holds all variables used in Olórin's programs. This file needs to have the SPARK_MASTER, DATABASE_IP, and KAFKA_BROKERS updated during setup. See setup instructions for details. This file needs to be distributed to the producer, spark master, and visualizer nodes. This is accomplished by using ‘setup_scripts/variable_push.sh’ during the setup procedure.
