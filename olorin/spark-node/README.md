## Spark Node

# Redis

Running redis_start_consumer.sh from the spark master EC2 instance will initialize Olórin. Note, the EC2 ip address in in this bash script needs to be set to the Spark master IP before running. This is covered in the setup procedure.

# PostgreSQL

Running postgresql_start_consumer.sh from the spark master EC2 instance will initialize Olórin. Note, the EC2 ip address in in this bash script needs to be set to the Spark master IP before running. This is covered in the setup procedure. This is legacy code that is retained for comparison purposes to demonstrate the improvements of switching to Redis.
